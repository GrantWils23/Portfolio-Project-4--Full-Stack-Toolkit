## Data Model

Here you can find the logical flow chart that I made to help me create the data model... <a href="link" target="_blank">link tag</a>. This was really useful in helping me understand the flow and direction on how to create the app and models, views and templates... etc... something along these lines

# Testing

To test my project, I have manually tested the project by doing the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        Testing the programs code in <a href="http://pep8online.com/" target="_blank">pep8online</a> and confirmed that there were no errors with the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tested the validations to prove the program is working correctly by entering invalid inputs and checking that all error types are accounted for (outside size of board parameters, same input cannot be inputted twice and strings are not excepted).
    </li>
    <li>
        Tested in the local terminal and the Code institute Heroku Terminal.
    </li>
</ul>

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

<ul>
    <li>I created a validation for checking if the guess made ca be found in the guesses but I didnt pass this validation into the code for the computers turn. This showed up that the
    computer was hitting targets it has already shot and missed. resulting in an unbalanced and unfair game experience wereby the user can have a greater chance at winning then the computer.</li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used

<li><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - The site was used to edit and host the website.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitpod.io/projects" target="_blank">GitPod</a> - Used in the deployment and creating the website.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> - This was used in the production to get the game running as it is required for the app to run.</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> - This was used in the production to get the game running as it is required for app to run.</li>
<li><a href="http://pep8online.com/" target="_blank">pep8online</a> - This site was used to validate the python code to check for any errors within my writing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> - This was used to deploy the game in a mock terminal that allows anyone to play the game online.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank">Python Libary Random</a> - This was used to generate random numbers within the games code for deployment of the ships or the computers random guesses.</li>

LIST A BUNCH OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PYTHON PACKAGES USED... DJANGO AND etc...

## Deployment

### Deployment of the project

<p> I deployed this site using Heroku which is a container based cloud platform where you can deploy, manage and scale applications. To deploy this project I used the following steps in Heroku:</p>
<li>Fork or clone a copy of this repository.</li>
<li>Log in or create an account in heroku.</li>

![image]("")

<li>click on the button in the right corner to create a new app.</li>

![image]()

<li>inside the app page, go to setting page (underlined in green) and set the buildpacks to "Python" and "Nodejs" in that order (like in the picture below).</li>

![image]()

<li>Link the heroku app to the repository.</li>
<li>Go back to the deploy page (underlined in yellow) and you can either choose to manually deploy the site or automatically.</li>
<li>Once it has deployed, it may take a fww minutes to load and you can play the game.</li>

<br>
<p>The link to the site can be found here - <a href=" link here " target="_blank">LINK HERE!!!!</a></p>

<br>

!!!! REMOVE DEBUG FROM TRUE TO FALSE BEFORE SUBMISSION !!!

### Cloning of the Project
<hr>
<p>To create a local clone of the project, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the GitHub repository, under the repository name there is a code tab., click on the <b>code</b> tab.</li>
    <li>In the clone tab, click the HTTPS tab. Within this section, click on the clipboard icon and copy the URL supplied for the repository.</li>
    <li>Open an IDE of your choosing and run Git Bash.</li>
    <li>Change the current working directory to the location of which you wish to place the cloned repository.</li>
    <li>In the terminal, write <b>Git Clone</b> and then paste in the URL supplied via GitHub from step 2.</li>
    <li>Press enter and your new cloned repository will be created within the desired location.</li>
</ol>

## Credits

<p>I would like to say a small thanks to the Code institute for the first bit of help on how to setup the game and create objects models that have real value and functionality from their introduction video as it gave a good starting point on how to logically approach designing the game.</p>
