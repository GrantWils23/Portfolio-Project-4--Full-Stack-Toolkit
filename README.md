<h1>Portfolio_Project_4 --- FullStack_Toolkit</h1>
<h1>BeBeauty</h1>
<p>The Idea for this website came from a friend who runs a business as a mobile beautician and requested a website that of which she can take bookings from clients and has a way to manage her work diary. The beautician works remotely and therefore her business is a one person operation and finds it hard to manage her work accordingly when she has so much going on, so the idea of the website is to cut down her interactions on the phone with clients as she has to commute via car and train and is sometimes impossible for her to make appointments in her diary when she is either commuting or in the middle of a session. This app is aimed at expanding her reach of clients and all the while giving them more piece of mind that they can make bookings and it will be recorded and saved...</p>

## Wire Frames
The Wireframes for this project started off as a base idea with some users feedback from some of my friends who would use a service and they gave me feedback as time went on. These basic templates were the foundation of which the website style is built on but with the help of real user feedback I implemented it along the way.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178985692-836737f5-6fee-42d9-b257-758808ee361f.png)

## Site Structure
The site structure is extremely important to the clients who will wish to book an appointment with BeBeauty. It is imperative that the site is user friendly and easy to access, read, and find the pages you want to with the least hassle. The site structure will consist of a navigation menu bar that will be present at the top of all pages as well as a footer with the appropriate social links. The body of the pages will be broken down into the following...
<ul>
    <li>Home Page</li>
    <li>Services</li>
    <li>Prices</li>
    <li>Gallery</li>
    <li>Contact</li>
    <li>Sign Up</li>
    <li>Sign In</li>
    <li>Sign Out</li>
    <li>My Bookings</li>
    <li>Create Booking</li>
    <li>Booking Details</li>
    <li>Edit Booking</li>
    <li>Cancel Booking</li>
    <li>Delete Bookig</li>
    <li>Admin-Planner</li>
    <li>Admin Add Booking</li>
    <li>Admin Edit Booking</li>
    <li>Admin Cancel Booking</li>
    <li>Admin Delete Booking</li>
</ul>

The Desktop version of the site is very spacous but when the user drops down to a smaller aspect ratio the content will be forced to occupy a majority of the screen not to waste the restricted space that is left on the display. So any Wireframes above that take up larger areas with content and spacing will be forced to a column that occupies the screen so it displays all on one screen with no side to side juddering. This will greatly improve the UX as it will be easier to use on smaller devices, just as it would be on a desktop or larger screen device.

# Design Stylings
<hr>

## Colour Scheme
the colour scheme chosen for this website is sutble and chicque, requested by the client that it will have light tones to exert a professional look that is not overpowering to the views and that it is to be inviting to anyone who visits the site.
  - The blue tone colour settled upon is aliceblue which is a nice colour that gives some personaliry to website other than a standard white background.
  - The pink tone colour settled upon is mistyrose which is a beautiful light pink that really compliments the background colour.
  - The pink tones also come with some shadowing to give a bit more flair and dynamics to the buttons and icons.
  - Functional buttons within the booking pages hold a simple colour scheme of green, yellow, red, blue. The scheme is designed to draw attention appropriately with the nesessary information regarding a booking.

<br>

## Fonts
The fonts applied are really important to the websites appeal. The main font for the website's title was requested by the client to be eye-catching and refined, but at the sametime be strong and elegant. The font settled up was "Playfair Display" an it really ticks all the boxes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178712500-832da105-1ba9-4ab4-b24a-2147f79d05f4.png)


The second font for the general font for the website which was settled on which complements the title font was "Zilla Slab". It works well as it doesn't draw away from the attention of the main font and is easy to read but still is attractive to the users. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178712706-aff22d38-4992-4116-b90d-98a6b7cb19d0.png)

# Features
<hr>

## Existing Features

### Navigation Menu
- The nav menu is set at the top of all the pages. It is fully responsive and converts to a small dropdown menu on smaller screen ratios for a better UX. The nav contains links to all the pages of the site to enable quick searching through the website. 
- The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.
- The bookings tab will only appear if the user is authenticated and logged in otherwise their is no bookings to view within the nav menu which makes it clearer for new customers that you need to sign up to book appointments

### Services Page
The services page is designed to give the users a brief insight into the services of what the company offers is clients with a description of the beauticians experience and really is where you get a feel for the company and the professional nature of it. The page is designed to be eyecatching and give the user a well rounded experience as they view what company has to offer.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178738891-d482c632-cea1-486a-b77f-d7272512f8e7.png)


### Prices Page
The prices page gives and accurate breakdown of the services that BeBeauty has to offer ans well as the description and prices and approximate time it takes each session. It is displayed in a list format to give users a clear presentation that is navigate to the service they are most interested in. It uses a modal to display the larger information of each booking. The modals give the user a really user friendly feel as it is free flowing the colour scheme matches the rest of the websites design giving a very pleasent UX.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178738621-9bece993-1377-42d2-b84e-f27a04017072.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178738736-a1e20a78-e6fc-4e46-bd85-80b3f0c89727.png)


### Gallery
The gallery is a small sneakpeak of just some of the work that BeBeauty has done for some its clients. The current idea is to have a small sample of photos with which the users can see at the moment. If the users want to view more they are encouraged to check them out on the social media links located below for more day to day photos if you follow them on the likes of Instagram or Facebook. This will likely change and the owner may wish that they have a more robust website with a larger gallery later on.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178739016-b4d4c666-d7c9-44ab-b602-a63050b91e5c.png)


### Contact
The contact page is small and consists of the T&C's of the company's policy and how they operate. It is a clean format that clearly labels all important details regarding any bookings.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178741286-6607523f-77b7-4833-8500-b4fe8820ed3e.png)


### The Booking Form
The booking form is a simple and easy to use, once signed in it knows you are a valid user and so it generates the user and email name already for submission.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178740493-0c2a52f6-af0e-49ca-9dce-0b9a7b31c1dd.png)


### My Bookings
The bookings page is a paginated page that displays a max of 6 appointments on any one page before having to cycle through to view more previous bookings. Its list view is very easy and clear to read and is set up according to the booking reference. The page displays the most significant information within the list view and has a link to view the booking attached to it. to the right side is the bookings edit and cancel buttons that give the user the abilty to edit and cancel bookings or just to view old or completed bookings.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178739501-9bc45d9c-aaed-409b-ac30-13405a2dfdf2.png)


### Booking Details
The booking page holds all realevant details required regarding the booking. Located at the bottom of each booking is again buttons to edit and cancel the booking giving the user more than one way just to alter a booking, which prevents having to scroll through multiple pages just to alter it and giving the user a warmer UX.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178742207-3c9c101e-bbb9-48ba-b6be-fa482c878ae5.png)


### Cancel and Delete Bookings
This Page is a warning page for the user, it alerts them to the actions they plan on taking. By diverting to a new page it gives the user a warning in clue of a visible prompt that with the request they plan to make will alter the booking in some way, this gives the user a greateer UX when it comes to making sure they didn't cancel the booking by accident.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178741783-e1991d20-abf3-4c8c-9072-ca5c367ee852.png)

### Footer
The Footer is lightweight and is very minimialistic, This gives greater UX to the rest of the page as the footer displays social media links which is there for users who want to view more about the company outside of the dedicated website. The links are large and blend in with the rest of the page to show there is some significance in clicking the links. The social links would be directly linked to the the businesses pages once the website is set for production.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178743421-51723903-10ab-450b-8558-21e869f35146.png)

### Pop-up messages
The pop up messages are intergrated into the websites UX to provide the user with some useful feedback information. The messages will display on the success of a given task like signing in or upon a compeletion of a given task, or in the event of something failing, like the appointment booking is not possible, it will throw and error to the user in a message box. below are some examples...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178992505-afc8e9df-c791-4379-84a1-7a1edc6c4906.png)

## Input Validation and checking

Validation of the form is implemented by checking  before the document is submitted is valid to submit. This is acheived by multiple methods

<ul>
    <li>To validate the phonenumber being entered into the form, django-phonenumber-field was used. It checks the input to see if it is a valid phonenumber and returns an error message if it is not valid upon submission</li>
    <li>To validate the date of which a booking can be made, within the form.py is code to check that the date of which the form is greater than the date the booking is being made. If the booking is in today or before, The form is not valid and is returned to be resubmitted.</li>
</ul>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178716912-c029e08e-f0ac-465c-b7a8-6b1ff8a945ff.png)

<ul>
    <li>Validation of the Bookings that cannot coexist was implemented by making a constraint within the database and when such appointment already exists with the parameters of appointment_date and appointment_slot are met, then the code throws an error and addresses the user to pick another day or time for the appointment. (This was a bug I solved)</li>
</ul>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178721734-56da133c-8ff3-4175-8040-db75e741501f.png)

## Data Model

Here below you can find the Data schema used to create the data model. This was really useful in helping me understand the flow and direction on how to create the app models, views and templates. A well working data schema is really important to the database be established properly for the website to work correctly. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/180508284-61cee041-2d54-41ae-b696-d54960757d1f.png)

### Features left to implement

This can be a list of unfinished or future new user stories on how to improve the website.
<li>As the website grows, a larger gallery which would host more pictures would be advantageous</li>
<li>The ability to like photos in the gallery and upvote them would give the users a more integral feel and a feeling that their opinion matters</li>

# Testing

To test my project, I have manually tested the project by doing the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        Testing the programs code in <a href="http://pep8online.com/" target="_blank">pep8online</a> and confirmed that there were no errors with the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tested the validations to prove the program is working correctly by entering invalid inputs and checking that all error types are accounted for (outside size of board parameters, same input cannot be inputted twice and strings are not excepted).
    </li>
    <li>
        Tested in the local terminal and the Code institute Heroku Terminal.
    </li>
</ul>

On a whole the tests have been successful in the desktop view and responsive view. This is a really good return on my the test that show the website is working correctly and behaving as is expected.</p>

## Automated Testing
<p>To check the code, I ran <a href="https://pypi.org/project/coverage/" target="_blank">Coverage</a> (A Third party pacakge) to check how well my Automated tests performed. The report came back with a 73% coverage, the biggest areas that would require more comprehensive tests are the booking/views.py and the booking/forms.py. On a whole, The tests I have writen have performed well but ideally greater coverage would be preferential.</p>
<li>I ran 27 tests with a 73% coverage.</li>
<li>To run these tests, you need to run the command <i>"python3 manage.py test"</i> in the terminal.</li>

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs
<ul>
    <li>I had found a bug whereby if I booked an appointment on the same day as someone else has already done with the same time slot, I would get multiple bookings that match and it would not be possible for the Beautician to attend both and would require manual checking.
    To get over this problem, I put a constraint into the database stating that a booking cannot be placed if the booking requested with these parameters already exists. </li>
    <li> A bug was found in the admin booking view which was when the submit button was hit, a 500 error handler popped up. I resolved the issue by changing the form to take in a new form model and template which gave the admin greater control of the booking.</li>
</ul>

## Deployment

### Deployment of the project
<!-- DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS -->

<p>To deploy the site is a labour intensive process. To start we need copy(clone) or fork the repository. Then when ready, go into your working environment and from the terminal we need pip to install all the necessary pyhton packages for the app to run. Using pip, install the requirements.txt file. this is achived with the command line code of " .... ".</p>

<p>once you have installled all the necessary packages, you will need to configure your settings.py file to contain the appropriate environmental variables for the site to operate. </p>

<p>sensative data that doesn't want to be exposed on the internet, should be added into a env.py file with all the sensative data is stored away and not exposed in github, making it vulnerable to attacks. the env.py file has then to be added to the .gitignore file to prevent git uploading the sensative data to the internet.</p>

<!--  -->
<p> I deployed this site using Heroku which is a container based cloud platform where you can deploy, manage and scale applications. To deploy this project I used the following steps in Heroku:</p>
<li>Fork or clone a copy of this repository.</li>
<li>Log in or create an account in heroku.</li>

![image]("")

<li>click on the button in the right corner to create a new app.</li>

![image]()

<li>inside the app page, go to setting page (underlined in green) and set the buildpacks to "Python" and "Nodejs" in that order (like in the picture below).</li>

![image]()

<li>Link the heroku app to the repository.</li>
<li>Go back to the deploy page (underlined in yellow) and you can either choose to manually deploy the site or automatically.</li>
<li>Once it has deployed, it may take a fww minutes to load and you can play the game.</li>

## Credits

<p>I would like to say a small thanks to the Code institute for the first bit of help on how to setup the game and create objects models that have real value and functionality from their introduction video as it gave a good starting point on how to logically approach designing the game.</p>
